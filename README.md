# Linear Search

### Objective
In this project, our main goal is to understand the linear search algorithm.


### Problem
Create a doubly linked list corresponding to the following diagram and linear search function to search for the value of 9.

### Implementation
* In the DoublyLinkedList class, implement a `linear search` function to search for the target, and  print the number of iterations it took to find the target value.
* In the `main` method, call the linear Search function with 9 as a target.
                                           
```java
   public void linearSearch(int target) {
          /*add your code here*/
   }
```
```java
public class Main{
   public static void main(String[] args) {
        /*add your code here*/
   }
}
```
